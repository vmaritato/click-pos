# Contributing to click-pos

Thank you for your interest in contributing! Your help is welcome.

## How to Contribute

- **Fork** the repository and create your branch from `main`.
- **Write clear, conventional commit messages** (e.g. `feat:`, `fix:`, `docs:`, `test:`).
- **Add or update tests** for any new features or bug fixes.
- **Run all tests** before submitting (`npm test`).
- **Format your code** with Prettier (`npm run format`).

- Use Prettier for formatting (see `.prettierrc`).
- Prefer named exports, no default exports.
